## Git and Github

### 11 January 2024

Main purposes of using GitHub:
- Preserve your work
- Enable exploration
- Build a portfolio
- Collaborate with other users
- Prove your work
- Obtain experience with the industry standard

A merge becomes necessary when two contributors edit and commit changes to the same line of code.

Forking a repository, making changes, and submitting a pull request is a useful way to contribute to open-source projects.

Four-step process for using git:
1. Pull to get the most up-to-date code
2. Work on a small piece of code to implement something cohesive
3. Commit and push
4. Repeat
